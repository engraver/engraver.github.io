## Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (2014-2019)

I lectured courses in Software engineering, Near field electrodynamics (both at the Faculty of Radio Physics, Electronics and Computer Systems) and Scientific world view (Institute of philology). 

### Software engineering 
Software engineering was the one-semester course for the third-year students of computer engineering major, which included 1.5 lectures and 1 laboratory work per week. The course aim is to provide key competencies for software developers in design and best practices of work with large enough and reusable code relying on OOP principles. The topics covered are: design patterns (GOF), refactoring, testing strategies, version control systems and code metrics. I thank the author of the original course, Dr. Vira Gryaznova, for her valuable help.

### Near-field electrodynamics
Near-field electrodynamics was a one-semester course for the second-year students of radioengineering major, which included 1 lecture per week and laboratory work per two weeks. The objective is to provide an understanding of near-field physics and technologies relying on near-field effects for undergraduates.  The course topics cover brief fundamentals of electrodynamics, near fields of the simplest antenna types, numerics in electrodynamics including fundamentals of finite elements method, and applications (skin effect, wave guides and resonators, near-field trapping).

### Scientific world view

Scientific world view was the general, one-semester lecture course for the second-year students of the Institute of philology. Having as the objective to provide a universal education for the university students of socio-humanitarian majors, the course covered selected topics of history of science, philosophy of science, principles of digital and information technologies. [Guidance materials](/research/books.md#education) were published in co-authorship. 

### Other

Other teaching activities included practical works on electrodynamics, mathematical physics, higher mathematics and biological physics (for students of Institute of Biology and Medicine, in English), and laboratory works on fundamentals of programming (C++, C#) and numerical methods.
