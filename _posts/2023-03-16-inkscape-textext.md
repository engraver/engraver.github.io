Preparing images for further usage in beamer presentations in latex, it is useful to utilize latex fonts. This can be done via [TexText](https://inkscape.org/~jcwinkler/%E2%98%85textext) extension for [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

Then, the following command enables beamer font:
```
\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
```
