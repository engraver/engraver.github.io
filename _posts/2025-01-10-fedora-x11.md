X11 package is disabled by default in Fedora KDE, so we install it back:
```bash
sudo dnf install plasma-workspace-x11 kwin-x11
```

Then, it should be enabled in SDDM configuration. We need to edit `/etc/sddm.conf`:
```bash
# Control x11/wayland startup
# DisplayServer=wayland
DisplayServer=x11
```

Optionally, it may be needed to select Plasma (X11) desktop in the SDDM greetings window. 

P. S. Still I do not undestand why Insynk does not work with the default Wayland and requires X11 configuration to sync google drive accounts.
