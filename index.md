## Welcome!

I am Oleksandr V. Pylypovskyi, a physicist working in the field of magnetism. After getting a PhD in theoretical physics in 2016, I worked as an assistant professor at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (Ukraine) and moved to Germany in 2019. Now I am a researcher at the [Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf e.V.](https://hzdr.de) in the department of Intelligent materials and systems. In parallel, I'm remotely lecturing in [Kyiv Academic University](https://kau.org.ua) and serving as an editorial board member in [Communications Materials](https://www.nature.com/commsmat/).

## Research interests

* Magnetic symmetries, fundamentals of ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials
* Properties of magnetic topological solitons
* Computational methods in physics

Among recent achievements of our group, it is worth  highlighting understanding of the [flexomagnetic effect at finite temperatures](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34233-5) and [symmetry analysis of nominally compensated crystal cuts](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.226702) in magnetoelectric antiferromagnet chromia. We actively explore the field of curvilinear magnetism, looking at the interplay between [geometric and magnetic topologies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46403-8), and further analyze [curvilinear magnetoelectrics](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.013088) in complex geometries.
