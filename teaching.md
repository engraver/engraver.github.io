### After-school events
Co-organizer and referee in [Computer Experiment Team Olympiad](https://sites.google.com/view/tolymp/ceto) (CETO) and [Experimental Physics Olympiad](https://sites.google.com/view/tolymp/expho) (ExPhO). The goal of these two community-driven olympiads is to &laquo;give a taste&raquo; of collective solving of experimental scientific puzzles in fields of physics and computer experiment for school children. The ExPhO activities were started in 2012 with efforts of Mykola Semenyakin and Oksana Chelpanova. We established CETO in 2019 to develop skills in scientific computing and popularize numerical methods in science.
